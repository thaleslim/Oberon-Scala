TODOs:

 - [ ] ReadInt && ReadBool:
 
 * Create Scanf() like method.

 - [x] ProceduresDeclaration(Class) && ProcedureCall(Comand)
 
 * Procedures' args needs improvement;
 * Probable solution is through the use of oberon.expression.Variable: but it needs a way to compare DataTypes to be usable.

 - [ ] FunctionsDeclaration(Class) && FunctionsCall(Expression):
 
 * Needs a way to connect the name to the CommandBlock, Map structure.

 - [ ] Exceptions:
 
 * Create more Exceptions, like InvalidArgument, to have a more direct Error Message.
